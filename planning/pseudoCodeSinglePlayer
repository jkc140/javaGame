Game starts
  - create 5 instances of ship
    - one instance with length of 2
    - two instances with length of 3
    - one instance with lenght of 4
    - one instance with lenght of 5
    ^ generate method 
        - store generated objects in array ??
          - ships[] gShips= new ships[5]
            ships[0].length=2;
            ships[1].length=3;
            ships[2].length=3;
            etc
 - ask user for the inputs of where they want the ships to go 
    - // (one ship at a time)
    - get info for position and store it in ships[].

        - if the distance between spaces is the same length of the ship
        - if the position has been occupied already
 - display location of all ships
    - grey squares
